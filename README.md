Hello fellow developer. You have reached the place where your work will shine in all its glory. Read through the info below to know how you can contribute to this repository.

## How to contribute as a moderator
Thank you for considering helping out with sorting and triaging pull requests. We get a lot of pull requests that are often nog in a correct form to be able to approve right away. 

As a moderator, please do the following:
- open a pull request and see if you can easily find the source code for a lab (if not, add a comment + label "needs update")
- see if you can find a live preview (codesandbox or vercel) to the solution (if not, add a comment + label "live preview missing")
- see if commit messages are in correct form (if not, add a comment + label "commit messages not ok")
- if a lab seems ok, just add the label "ready to approve" and your teacher will approve the lab if possible

## How to contribute as a student?
### 1 - fork this repository
Forking this repository will create a copy of this repository to your own github account, while also maintaining a link to the original (this) repo.
This allows you to send in a *pull request* containing changes you want to make to this repository without having direct write access to it.

Think about it this way: a project like Wordpress likes getting bug fixes or other code improvements but it wouldn't be wise to just give anyone in the world write access to its codebase. If they did that, anyone could introduce malicious code or simply destroy the whole project within seconds.

That's why most open source project will accept pull requests, where you can present the code you'd like to contribute to a project while the project owner or maintainers have the control over what to accept and what to decline.

### 2 - create a pull request (repeat for each lab)
A pull request should *only* contain the changes you would like to add to this repository. You can also think about this in terms of a *difference* between the current state of this repo and your own repo. If this repo contains just one file for now (readme.md) and your forked repo contains two files (readme.md + yourname.md), then the difference will be `yourname.md`. That file will be presented to the owner of this repo and the owner then has the choice to either accept or decline your pull request. 

To send in your weekly labs, we want to see a file called `yourname.md` which of course should have your own name. Inside of that file, add a link to your lab which you have created in your own personal public repository. Here, I only need the have the link to find my way to your lab's code.

Below is an example of what your file could look like after a couple of weeks. Be creative and make this your own little nice portfolio file you want to present to me. As long as it's clear to me where I can find your labs, you should be good to go!
